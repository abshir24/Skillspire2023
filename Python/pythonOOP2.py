# 1. Gambling game. Create a Boxer class that has size, 
# strength, wins and losses properties. Make sure to use the CONSTRUCTOR function 
# to give values to all these properties.

# 2. In the class create a function that displays the boxerâ€™s stats 
# (Size, Strength, Wins, Losses). 

# 3.Create 2 Boxer objects and print out all the information on both boxers.

# 4. Then use the input function to prompt the user to choose which boxer 
# they would like to bet on.

# 5. If the user chooses the boxer that has the best properties in size strength and 
# wins and losses then the user wins their bet. Other wise the user loses.
